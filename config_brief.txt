Contains the configuration of the eeprom linked with the ft232h. cha_type=FIFO is the line which causes the ft232h starts as usb<->fifo converter. Don't forget it!
You probably should check the version of the main.c of the ftdi_eeprom program to see if the option is present otherwise check for another version of this program (or
as Stallman said, you can modify it and then share it....)

How to install/use:
-------------------

install libftdi1.2-dev
	- download package, untar the archive
	- go into, mkdir build
	- go into build folder
	- cmake ..
	- make
	- make install

use the freshly built ftdi_eeprom program and to configure the eeprom type:
	ftdi_eeprom --flash-eeprom ft232h.conf
	- it writes a dump of the configuration written in the eeprom as eeprom.new
	- you should see something like that :

./ftdi_eeprom --flash-eeprom ft232h.conf

FTDI eeprom generator v0.17
(c) Intra2net AG and the libftdi developers <opensource@intra2net.com>
FTDI read eeprom: 0
EEPROM size: 256
FIXME: Build FT232H specific EEPROM settings
Used eeprom space: 220 bytes
FTDI write eeprom: 0
Writing to file: eeprom.new
FTDI close: 0

Then you can start to use a program which opens the ft232h as a USB<->FIFO converter, using setBitMode(..... BITMODE_SYNC_FIFO);. You can find all the options in the definition
of the ftdi.h file
